# Bezier Editor

This is a simple cubic Bezier curve editor that I created while learning about the mathematics of such curves.

The are more features I would like to add (e.g. splines), but the vanilla JS architecture is not the best suited for increasing complexity. If I were starting the project today, I would probably select a declarative/reactive framework like [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/).
